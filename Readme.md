### NOTE TAKER
A simple application that handles basic note taking functionality. 

The application was built using a combination of Node.js, and Express.

## INSTALLATION / USAGE
No Installation necessary, Simply boot the application through the provided Heroku deployment link () and follow the prompts.

The user is capable of typing in their own notes and saving them,
along with deleting any previous notes that they do not like.

As it currently stands, there is a small bug, in which the information is lost when the browser is shut down, but since this is more of a proof of concept more than anything, that's probably acceptable.
